# Smart Car Cloud Architecture Using AWS

## Overview
This project focuses on designing a cloud-based architecture for smart cars using AWS services. The system enables IoT-based smart cars to send data to the cloud for processing, analysis, and storage. It supports real-time data analytics, machine learning model deployment, and over-the-air (OTA) updates to enhance smart car features and ensure scalability and security.

## Architecture Components
- Smart Cars (IoT Devices): Equipped with IoT sensors, these cars send data (e.g., location, speed) to the cloud for further processing.
- AWS IoT Core: Manages communication between smart cars and the cloud, ensuring secure data transmission.
- AWS Kinesis Data Stream: Captures and processes real-time data streams from IoT devices.
- AWS Lambda: Automatically processes incoming data from Kinesis and routes it to the appropriate AWS services.
- Amazon S3: Stores raw data from IoT devices for long-term storage and analysis.
- Amazon RDS: Stores structured data for analysis and reporting.
- Amazon DynamoDB: Handles unstructured data for low-latency access.
- AWS Glue: Performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks to prepare data for analysis.
- Amazon Redshift: Data warehousing for large-scale data analysis.
- Amazon QuickSight: Provides data visualization to create reports and dashboards.
- Amazon SageMaker: Builds and deploys machine learning models to improve smart car functionality.
- AWS Greengrass: Facilitates local data processing and software updates (OTA) on smart cars.

## Workflow
- Data Collection: Smart cars collect data and send it to AWS IoT Core.
- Data Processing: Data is forwarded to AWS Kinesis, where it is processed by AWS Lambda and routed to storage.
- Data Storage: Raw data is stored in Amazon S3, structured data in Amazon RDS, and unstructured data in DynamoDB.
- Data Analysis: AWS Glue performs ETL, and data is analyzed using Redshift and Kinesis Data Analytics for real-time insights.
- Machine Learning: AWS SageMaker is used to build and deploy models that improve smart car features, such as personalized driving recommendations.
- OTA Updates: AWS Greengrass enables software updates and local data processing on IoT devices, ensuring smart cars stay up to date remotely.

## Key AWS Services
- Amazon Rekognition: Provides image analysis capabilities for smart car camera systems.
- Amazon API Gateway: Manages API requests for image uploads and interactions with backend services.
- Amazon S3: Stores image data for analysis and retrieval.
- Amazon RDS/DynamoDB: Stores analysis results and ensures high availability with multi-region redundancy.

## AWS Rekognition Workflow Example :
1. A user uploads an image via a chatbot interface.
2. Amazon API Gateway receives the image upload request and stores it in Amazon S3.
3. AWS Lambda is triggered by the upload to process the image using Amazon Rekognition.
4. Rekognition analyzes the image and sends the results back to AWS Lambda.
5. The results are stored in Amazon RDS/DynamoDB, and the chatbot returns the results to the user.
